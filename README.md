# Coding Skills for AI Agents

Foundational coding principles as AI agent skills. KISS, DRY, SOLID, YAGNI, Separation of Concerns, Law of Demeter, Boy Scout Rule, Convention over Configuration — plus a stack detection skill that makes them all language-aware. Works with Claude Code, OpenAI Codex, Cursor, Windsurf, and any agent that supports the [Agent Skills spec](https://agentskills.io).

Built by [Jordan Coin Jackson](https://github.com/JordanCoin). Contributions welcome — [open a PR](#contributing) or [file an issue](https://github.com/JordanCoin/codingskills/issues).

## What Are These?

Skills are markdown files that give AI agents specialized knowledge for specific tasks. These skills teach agents *how to think about code quality* — not syntax, not framework APIs, but the principles that separate code that ships reliably from code that breaks in production.

Each skill includes:
- **Rules** — concrete, actionable guidelines (not platitudes)
- **Anti-patterns** — what violations actually look like in real code
- **Examples** — before/after showing the principle applied
- **Boundaries** — when NOT to apply the principle (every principle has limits)
- **Code review checklist** — for agents reviewing PRs or auditing codebases

## How Skills Work Together

Every skill reads `.agents/stack-context.md` first (generated by `detect-stack`) to understand the project's language, framework, and conventions. Then it applies the principle idiomatically — Rust patterns for Rust, Python patterns for Python, etc.

      Skills cross-reference each other:

        boy-scout-rule ↔ convention-over-configuration ↔ kiss

## Available Skills

<!-- SKILLS:START -->
| Skill | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| [kiss](skills/kiss/) | Reduce complexity and improve readability. Use when code is "too complex," "hard to read," or "can't follow this." |
| [dry](skills/dry/) | Eliminate duplicated knowledge and business logic. Use when "this is duplicated" or "we have this in two places." |
| [yagni](skills/yagni/) | Prevent over-engineering and speculative features. Use when code is "over-engineered" or builds for "just in case." |
| [solid](skills/solid/) | Design module boundaries and interfaces for maintainable architecture. SRP, OCP, LSP, ISP, DIP. |
| [separation-of-concerns](skills/separation-of-concerns/) | Structure code into layers with clear boundaries. Use when "this function does too much" or "fat controller." |
| [law-of-demeter](skills/law-of-demeter/) | Reduce coupling and deep object chains. Use when code has "train wrecks" or "mocking is painful." |
| [boy-scout-rule](skills/boy-scout-rule/) | Leave code better than you found it — incrementally. Use when touching existing code and spotting small improvements. |
| [convention-over-configuration](skills/convention-over-configuration/) | Establish patterns and reduce configuration overhead. Use when "too much config" or "inconsistent structure." |
| [detect-stack](skills/detect-stack/) | Analyze a codebase to detect language, framework, conventions, and CI gates. Generates `.agents/stack-context.md`. |

## Installation

### Option 1: CLI Install (Recommended)

```bash
# Install all skills
npx skills add JordanCoin/codingskills

# Install specific skills
npx skills add JordanCoin/codingskills --skill kiss dry solid

# List available skills
npx skills add JordanCoin/codingskills --list
```

### Option 2: Claude Code Plugin

```bash
/plugin marketplace add JordanCoin/codingskills
/plugin install coding-skills
```

### Option 3: Clone and Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/JordanCoin/codingskills.git
cd your-project && /path/to/codingskills/install.sh
```

This copies skills to `.agents/skills/` and symlinks `.claude/skills/` for Claude Code compatibility.

### Option 4: Git Submodule

```bash
git submodule add https://github.com/JordanCoin/codingskills.git .agents/codingskills
```

### Option 5: Fork and Customize

Fork, tweak the principles for your team's conventions, clone into your projects.

### Option 6: SkillKit (Multi-Agent)

```bash
npx skillkit install JordanCoin/codingskills
```

## Usage

Once installed, just ask your agent to help with code quality:

```
"Simplify this function"
→ Uses kiss skill

"Is this over-engineered?"
→ Uses yagni skill

"Review this PR for code quality"
→ Uses kiss, dry, law-of-demeter skills

"Audit this codebase for tech debt"
→ Uses all skills sequentially
```

Invoke skills directly:

```
/kiss
/dry
/solid
/yagni
/separation-of-concerns
/law-of-demeter
/boy-scout-rule
/convention-over-configuration
/detect-stack
```

## When to Apply Each Principle

| Situation | Primary | Supporting |
|-----------|---------|------------|
| Adding a new feature | yagni | kiss, separation-of-concerns |
| Refactoring | separation-of-concerns, solid | dry, boy-scout-rule |
| Reviewing a PR | kiss, dry | law-of-demeter, convention-over-configuration |
| Fixing a bug | boy-scout-rule, kiss | separation-of-concerns |
| Designing module boundaries | separation-of-concerns, solid | law-of-demeter |
| Choosing between approaches | kiss, yagni | convention-over-configuration |
| Organizing project structure | convention-over-configuration | separation-of-concerns, solid |
| Reducing coupling | law-of-demeter, solid | separation-of-concerns |
| Auditing for tech debt | all | run detect-stack first, then each principle |

## Stack Detection

The `detect-stack` skill scans your project and generates `.agents/stack-context.md` with:
- Language and version
- Framework and database layer
- Build, test, lint, and format tools
- CI gate configuration
- Project conventions and naming patterns

Every other skill reads this file first and applies principles idiomatically for your stack. No static reference files per language — agents use their built-in knowledge plus [context7 MCP](https://github.com/upstash/context7) for framework-specific details on demand.
